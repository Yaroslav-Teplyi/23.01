                        Immortal is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen. The group was founded in 1991 by frontman and guitarist Abbath and guitarist Demonaz. The pair worked with various drummers, and were later joined by current drummer Horgh in 1996. Immortal's lyrics are based on an overall theme, a realm called Blashyrkh, which is said to be "demon-and-battle-filled" and a "fusion of gothic, Nordic, and heroic themes.

                        Metallica is an American thrash metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. My favorite albums are Ride The Lightning and Kill 'Em All.
