                    Immortal is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen. The group was founded in 1991 by frontman and guitarist Abbath and guitarist Demonaz. The pair worked with various drummers, and were later joined by current drummer Horgh in 1996. Immortal's lyrics are based on an overall theme, a realm called Blashyrkh, which is said to be "demon-and-battle-filled" and a "fusion of gothic, Nordic, and heroic themes.

                    Furfur is a French raw black metal band from Saint-Nazaire. This is one-man band founded in 2017 by Berith. Furfur's lyrics are based on anti-religion, philosophy, sadness. My favorite songs are Ultra Violence and L'éclat du passé.
